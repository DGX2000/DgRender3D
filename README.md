# DgRender3D
A 3D rendering library for personal use and learning purposes.

## Stuff to do

- [ ] scene graph: mesh/transform objects as nodes (cache transform/bounding box)
- [ ] camera
- [ ] lighting (blinn-phong)
- [ ] lighting maps
- [ ] multiple lights
- [ ] load glTf models
- [ ] CSG with buffers
- [ ] transparency/blending
- [ ] mirrors, framebuffers, render to texture
- [ ] cubemap, skybox
- [ ] anti-aliasing
- [ ] gamma correction
- [ ] shadow mapping
- [ ] normal mapping
- [ ] parallax mapping
- [ ] deferred rendering, with hybrid approach for transparency
- [ ] bloom
- [ ] HDR
- [ ] SSAO
- [ ] ray marching
- [ ] cartoon/cel shader (+posterization)
- [ ] god rays
- [ ] water shader
